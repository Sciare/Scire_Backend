# API Documentation

The API documentation gets generated along with the code in Swagger format.

You can see the documentation under the /swagger url for the corresponding environment.

For security reasons we are hiding the swagger documentation under Basic Authentication.

The credentials are currently:

    Username: admin
    Password: password

(This is setup in the environment variables for the backend)
